I’m an ecologist and urban beekeeper with over 20 years of experience working with bees in New York City. I co-founded the New York Bee Club and have a long-standing interest in pollinators, sustainability, and community science.

These days, I’m focused on building open-source tools for ecology and field research, using Python, JavaScript, C++ (JUCE), and the occasional Raspberry Pi. My projects usually combine mapping, data, and real-world fieldwork—sometimes for pollinators, sometimes just for fun.

I also make electronic music as FocusZero.

Most of what you’ll find here blends tech, ecology, and music in some way. Always happy to connect with others working in similar spaces.
