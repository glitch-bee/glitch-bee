I’m an ecologist and urban beekeeper with over 20 years of experience keeping bees in the city. I am a co-founder of the New York Bee Club, where we focus on growing the community and sharing knowledge about pollinators and sustainability.

Alongside beekeeping, I’m into coding and building projects with Python, C++ (JUCE), and Raspberry Pi—mostly for music and environmental tools. I also produce electronic music as FocusZero.

On this page, you’ll find projects that mix my interests in ecology, tech, and music. Feel free to check them out or get in touch!
